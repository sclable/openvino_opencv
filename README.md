# openvino_opencv
Various different examples (image classification, object detection and image segmentation) of using OpenVINO with OpenCV

### Overview about the notebooks
1. Model downloader - to download models from OpenVINO model zoo. 
2. Model conversion - to convert the model from their native format to IR format. 
3. Image classification using MobileNetV2 model. 
4. Image classification using Inception ResNet V2 model. 
5. Face detection using a webcam and model inference performed on NCS 2. 
6. General object detection using MobileNetV2 and SSD based model. 
7. Road segmentation using semantic segmentation model. 
8. Custom pavement cracks segmentation model based on the UNet model.
